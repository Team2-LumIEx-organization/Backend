## Parcel Locker System Application Development Documentation

## The project developers

The project is developed by the second-year Information Technology students from Oulu University of Applied Sciences.In the second period of our second year study we got the opportunity to work on a Advance Web Development Project(Parcel Locker System).We tried our best to fullfil all the reqirements of the project.It was fun and at the same time challanging to impliment all the functionality of the project but at the end we have accomplished the project through teamwork.Introduction of the teammembers:-


- **Ashif Moon**, [GitHub account](https://github.com/AshifkhaMoon)
- **Lufei Wu**, [GitHub account](https://github.com/lufeiwu22)
- **Minyi Zhang**, [GitHub account](https://github.com/minyizhangg)
- **Ziqi Li**, [GitHub account](https://github.com/ZiqiLi28)

We have been working together throughout the whole project and everyone has been equally active in the development of the project.


## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to develop a parcel locker system application which in total has three apps Consumer App,Driver App,Touch Screen Simulator and also a Parcel Generator Robot. The Project enables users to register, log in, send and receive parcels, and keep track of the status of their parcels in the lockers and after that a driver will pick up the parcel and deliver it to it's destination.The ultimate iteration of the system is intended for deployment on the public internet.We have successfully accomplished the framework of our Advanced Web Application Development course.

## Interface description

The system offers various functionalities through distinct perspectives, including:

- User Registration and Login: Users can sign up for an account and log in to access the system.
- Parcel Delivery Interface: Users can input and dispatch details for a new parcel.
- Receive Parcel Interface: Users can access information about incoming parcels.
- Parcel Status Tracking: Enables users to monitor the status of parcels within the locker system.
- Locker Interface: Simulates a touchscreen interface for lockers, facilitating user interaction with the locker system.

## Installation and Usage Guide (Local Deployment)
